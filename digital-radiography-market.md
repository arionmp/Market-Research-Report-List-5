<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Digital Radiography Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>CR Tech Digital X-Ray System</li><li>DR Tech Digital X-Ray System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The digital radiography market comprises two primary types: Computed Radiography (CR) and Digital Radiography (DR) systems. CR technology utilizes a phosphor plate to capture images, which are then digitized by a scanner. This method is generally more cost-effective and easily integrates into existing systems. In contrast, DR technology employs digital sensors to capture images directly, offering immediate results and higher image quality. DR systems are often favored for their speed and efficiency in clinical settings, enhancing diagnostic capabilities.</p></p>
