<p><strong>The ICAD (Intracranial Atherosclerotic Disease) Pathology Treatment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Stent</li><li>PTA Balloon</li></ul></p>
<p><p>ICAD (Intracranial Atherosclerotic Disease) is characterized by the narrowing of intracranial arteries due to plaque buildup. Treatment options include stenting and PTA (Percutaneous Transluminal Angioplasty) balloons. Stenting involves placing a metal mesh device to keep the artery open, enhancing blood flow and reducing stroke risk. PTA balloons, on the other hand, are used to inflate and widen narrowed arteries temporarily. Both interventions aim to restore cerebral circulation, improve patient outcomes, and minimize complications associated with ICAD.</p></p>
