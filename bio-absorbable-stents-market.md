<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bio-absorbable Stents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Metallic Stents</li><li>Polymeric Stents</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The bio-absorbable stents market consists of two primary types: metallic stents and polymeric stents. Metallic stents, often made from biodegradable metals like magnesium or iron, provide temporary support to blood vessels and gradually dissolve over time, enhancing healing with minimal long-term foreign presence. Polymeric stents, crafted from biocompatible polymers, also dissolve and are customized for specific application needs. Both types aim to reduce complications associated with permanent stents while promoting effective vascular healing and reducing the risk of restenosis.</p></p>
