<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Heart Pacemaker Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Implantable Heart Pacemaker</li><li>External Heart Pacemaker</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The heart pacemaker market is divided into two main types: implantable heart pacemakers and external heart pacemakers. Implantable heart pacemakers are surgically placed within the body to regulate heart rhythms, providing long-term treatment for arrhythmias. These devices are typically compact and designed for continuous use. In contrast, external heart pacemakers are used temporarily, often in emergency or hospital settings, to manage heart function until more permanent solutions can be implemented. Both types are essential for effective cardiac care.</p></p>
