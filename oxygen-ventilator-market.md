<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Oxygen Ventilator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive Ventilator</li><li>Noninvasive Ventilator</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The oxygen ventilator market is primarily divided into two types: invasive and noninvasive ventilators. Invasive ventilators require intubation, connecting a tube directly to the patient's airway, suitable for severe respiratory failure cases. Noninvasive ventilators, on the other hand, use masks or nasal interfaces to assist breathing without invasive procedures, often for mild to moderate respiratory issues. These distinct categories cater to different patient needs, ensuring effective respiratory support across various healthcare settings.</p></p>
