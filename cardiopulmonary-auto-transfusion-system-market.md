<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cardiopulmonary Auto-transfusion System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>On-Pump Transfusion Device</li><li>Off-Pump Transfusion Device</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The cardiopulmonary auto-transfusion system market comprises two primary types: on-pump and off-pump transfusion devices. On-pump transfusion devices are used during surgical procedures where the heart-lung machine is in operation, allowing for the collection and reinfusion of blood lost during surgery. Off-pump transfusion devices, on the other hand, function without the heart-lung machine, enabling blood recovery during surgeries that do not require cardiopulmonary bypass. Both types enhance patient outcomes by minimizing blood loss and reducing the need for donor blood.</p></p>
