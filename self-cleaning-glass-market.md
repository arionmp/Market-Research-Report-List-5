<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Self-Cleaning Glass Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hydrophilic Coatings</li><li>Hydrophobic Coatings</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Self-cleaning glass is a type of innovative glass that is coated with either hydrophilic or hydrophobic coatings to repel dirt and water, making it easy to clean. Hydrophilic coatings attract water and help it spread across the surface, carrying dirt away. On the other hand, hydrophobic coatings repel water, causing it to bead up and roll off along with dirt particles. Both types of coatings are used in various applications such as windows, facades, and automotive glass to maintain a clean appearance.</p></p>
