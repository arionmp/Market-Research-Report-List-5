<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Brachytherapy Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>High Dose Rate (HDR) Brachytherapy</li><li>Low Dose (LDR) Brachytherapy</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The brachytherapy market comprises two primary types: High Dose Rate (HDR) and Low Dose Rate (LDR) brachytherapy. HDR brachytherapy delivers concentrated radiation in short bursts, allowing for precise treatment while minimizing damage to surrounding tissues. It's often used for cancers such as prostate and cervical. Conversely, LDR brachytherapy involves a continuous low dose of radiation over an extended period, typically using permanent implantable sources for conditions like early-stage prostate cancer. Both approaches enhance therapeutic efficacy based on individual patient needs.</p></p>
