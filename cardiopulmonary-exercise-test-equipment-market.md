<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cardiopulmonary Exercise Test Equipment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>With Treadmill</li><li>With Exercise Bike</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) equipment market is primarily segmented into two types: treadmill-based and exercise bike-based systems. Treadmill CPET utilizes a motorized treadmill to assess cardiovascular and respiratory performance through walking or running. This method simulates real-life physical activities and provides comprehensive biomechanical data. In contrast, exercise bike CPET employs stationary bikes, allowing for controlled, adjustable resistance while enabling easier assessment of patients with limited mobility. Both types serve crucial roles in diagnosing and monitoring cardiopulmonary health.</p></p>
