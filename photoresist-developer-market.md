<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Photoresist Developer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive Type</li><li>Negative Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The photoresist developer market is categorized into positive and negative types, based on the chemical behavior of the photoresist materials during the development process. Positive photoresists become soluble in the developer after exposure to light, allowing the desired pattern to be easily removed, making them suitable for high-resolution applications. In contrast, negative photoresists harden upon exposure, with the unexposed areas being washed away, offering excellent defect tolerance and high aspect ratios, which are valuable in various semiconductor and microfabrication processes.</p></p>
