<p><strong>The Inhaled Nitric Oxide (NO) Delivery Systems Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Infant</li><li>Adult</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Inhaled Nitric Oxide (NO) delivery systems are essential in both infant and adult markets for treating respiratory conditions. In infants, particularly those with neonatal respiratory distress or persistent pulmonary hypertension, NO aids in dilating pulmonary blood vessels, enhancing oxygenation. For adults, these systems are crucial in managing conditions such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), where NO improves lung function and reduces pulmonary hypertension. Both applications underscore NO's vital role in enhancing respiratory care.</p></p>
