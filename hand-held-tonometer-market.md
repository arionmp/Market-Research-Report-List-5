<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hand-held Tonometer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact Type</li><li>Non-contact Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The hand-held tonometer market is primarily divided into two types: contact and non-contact. Contact tonometers involve a probe that makes direct contact with the cornea to measure intraocular pressure (IOP), providing precise readings but requiring anesthetic drops and maintaining hygiene. Non-contact tonometers utilize a puff of air to assess IOP without touching the eye, ensuring greater comfort and reducing infection risk. Both types serve critical roles in glaucoma screening and monitoring eye health.</p></p>
